# RStudio-projects
Project done through uni for my course MATH3070 'Natural Resource Mathematics'.

The project uses a size spectrum model to predict how the total global fish biomass will change over the century due to climate change. 
The code uses data for predicted primary production from Phytoplankton, and feeds this into a size spectrum model to predict total biomass, and then compares these changes to the predicted changes in global sea surface teperatures.

The project includes visual maps to show the differences globally across the century, and to highlight which areas of the globe will be most affected.
